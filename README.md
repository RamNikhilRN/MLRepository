Machine learning I have implemented the work in Logistic Regression using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach.
In particular, implementing the log-likelihood loss gradient descent update rule. The basic perceptron learning update rule.
Implementing the iterative perceptron update function.
Data Loading and Preprocessing using Seaborn library
Implementing the (soft-margin) linear SVM, kernel SVM, using the SVC classifier from sklearn.

Kernel SVM. Implementing and exploring two types of clustering methods: K-means and Hierarchical Clustering.
